        CSS POSITIONING - DETAILED NOTES
        ========================================
        
        The 'position' property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element.
        
        1. position: static; (Default)
           - The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
           - The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have NO effect.
           
        2. position: relative;
           - The element is positioned relative to its normal position.
           - Setting top/right/bottom/left will cause it to be adjusted away from its normal position.
           - Other content will NOT be adjusted to fit into any gap left by the element.
           - Often used as a parent container for 'absolute' children.

        3. position: absolute;
           - The element is removed from the normal document flow; no space is created for the element in the page layout.
           - It is positioned relative to its nearest POSITIONED ancestor (an ancestor with any position other than static).
           - If no positioned ancestor exists, it uses the document body (viewport).
           - It can overlap other elements.

        4. position: fixed;
           - The element is removed from the normal document flow.
           - It is positioned relative to the VIEWPORT (browser window).
           - It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled.
           - Examples: Navigation bars, "Back to Top" buttons.

        5. position: sticky;
           - Toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position.
           - It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like fixed).
           - Requires at least one threshold (e.g., top: 0;).

        HELPER PROPERTIES
        -----------------
        - top, right, bottom, left: Used to position non-static elements.
        - z-index: Specifies the stack order of an element (which element should be in front/behind others). Only works on positioned elements (relative, absolute, fixed, sticky).
