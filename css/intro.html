    CSS INTRODUCTION - FOUNDATIONS OF CSS
    ========================================
    
    WHAT IS CSS?
    ------------
    CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
    It is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.
    CSS controls how HTML elements are displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.
    
    PURPOSE OF CSS:
    ---------------
    1. Separation of Concerns: Separates content (HTML) from presentation (CSS)
    2. Consistency: Apply consistent styling across multiple pages
    3. Maintainability: Easier to update and maintain website appearance
    4. Flexibility: Change the look of an entire website by modifying one CSS file
    5. Accessibility: Better control over layout for different devices and screen sizes
    
    
    ========================================
    FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS OF CSS
    ========================================
    
    1. SELECTORS
    ------------
    Definition: Selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style.
    
    Types of Selectors:
    - Element Selector: Targets HTML elements by tag name (e.g., p, h1, div)
    - Class Selector: Targets elements with a specific class attribute (e.g., .classname)
    - ID Selector: Targets a unique element with a specific id attribute (e.g., #idname)
    - Universal Selector: Targets all elements (e.g., *)
    - Attribute Selector: Targets elements based on attributes (e.g., [type="text"])
    - Pseudo-class Selector: Targets elements in a specific state (e.g., :hover, :focus)
    - Pseudo-element Selector: Targets specific parts of elements (e.g., ::before, ::after)
    - Combinator Selectors: Combines multiple selectors (e.g., descendant, child, sibling)
    
    
    2. PROPERTIES & VALUES
    ----------------------
    Definition: Properties are the aspects of the element you want to change (e.g., color, font-size).
    Values are the settings you apply to those properties (e.g., red, 16px).
    
    Syntax: property: value;
    Example: color: blue; font-size: 20px;
    
    
    3. THE CASCADE
    --------------
    Definition: The "Cascading" in CSS refers to the algorithm that determines which styles 
    are applied when multiple rules target the same element.
    
    Order of Importance (from highest to lowest):
    1. Inline styles (style attribute in HTML)
    2. IDs (#idname)
    3. Classes, attributes, and pseudo-classes (.classname, [type="text"], :hover)
    4. Elements and pseudo-elements (p, div, ::before)
    
    Note: !important declaration overrides normal cascade rules (use sparingly!)
    
    
    4. SPECIFICITY
    --------------
    Definition: Specificity is a weight that determines which CSS rule is applied when 
    multiple rules could apply to the same element.
    
    Specificity Calculation:
    - Inline styles: 1000 points
    - IDs: 100 points each
    - Classes, attributes, pseudo-classes: 10 points each
    - Elements, pseudo-elements: 1 point each
    
    Example: #header .nav li (100 + 10 + 1 = 111 specificity)
    
    
    5. INHERITANCE
    --------------
    Definition: Some CSS properties are inherited by child elements from their parent elements.
    
    Inherited Properties (examples):
    - color
    - font-family
    - font-size
    - line-height
    - text-align
    
    Non-Inherited Properties (examples):
    - margin
    - padding
    - border
    - background
    - width, height
    
    Note: You can force inheritance using the 'inherit' value
    
    
    6. THE BOX MODEL
    ----------------
    Definition: Every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box. The CSS box model 
    describes how these boxes are structured.
    
    Components (from inside out):
    1. Content: The actual content of the element (text, images, etc.)
    2. Padding: Space between content and border (transparent)
    3. Border: A border surrounding the padding
    4. Margin: Space outside the border (transparent, separates element from others)
    
    Box-sizing Property:
    - content-box (default): Width/height applies only to content
    - border-box: Width/height includes content, padding, and border
    
    
    7. DISPLAY PROPERTY
    -------------------
    Definition: The display property specifies how an element is displayed on the page.
    
    Common Values:
    - block: Element takes full width available, starts on new line (e.g., div, p, h1)
    - inline: Element takes only necessary width, doesn't start on new line (e.g., span, a)
    - inline-block: Hybrid - flows inline but can have width/height
    - none: Element is not displayed (removed from document flow)
    - flex: Creates a flex container for flexible layouts
    - grid: Creates a grid container for grid-based layouts
    
    
    8. POSITION PROPERTY
    --------------------
    Definition: The position property specifies the positioning method for an element.
    
    Values:
    - static (default): Normal document flow, not affected by top/right/bottom/left
    - relative: Positioned relative to its normal position
    - absolute: Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor
    - fixed: Positioned relative to the viewport (stays in place when scrolling)
    - sticky: Hybrid of relative and fixed (toggles based on scroll position)
    
    
    9. UNITS OF MEASUREMENT
    -----------------------
    Definition: CSS uses various units to specify sizes, lengths, and distances.
    
    Absolute Units:
    - px (pixels): Fixed size, most common
    - pt (points): 1pt = 1/72 inch
    - cm, mm, in: Physical measurements
    
    Relative Units:
    - % (percentage): Relative to parent element
    - em: Relative to font-size of element (or parent)
    - rem: Relative to font-size of root element (html)
    - vh/vw: Relative to viewport height/width (1vh = 1% of viewport height)
    - vmin/vmax: Relative to smaller/larger viewport dimension
    
    
    10. COLOR SYSTEMS
    -----------------
    Definition: CSS provides multiple ways to specify colors.
    
    Color Formats:
    - Named Colors: color: red; (140+ predefined names)
    - Hexadecimal: color: #FF0000; (6-digit hex code)
    - RGB: color: rgb(255, 0, 0); (red, green, blue values 0-255)
    - RGBA: color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5); (RGB + alpha transparency 0-1)
    - HSL: color: hsl(0, 100%, 50%); (hue, saturation, lightness)
    - HSLA: color: hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5); (HSL + alpha transparency)
    
    
    ========================================
    HOW TO APPLY CSS
    ========================================
    
    1. INLINE CSS
    -------------
    Definition: CSS applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
    Syntax: <p style="color: blue; font-size: 16px;">Text</p>
    
    Pros: Quick for single elements, highest specificity
    Cons: Not reusable, mixes content with presentation, hard to maintain
    
    
    2. INTERNAL CSS (EMBEDDED)
    --------------------------
    Definition: CSS written inside a <style> tag in the HTML document's <head> section.
    Syntax:
    <head>
        <style>
            p { color: blue; }
        </style>
    </head>
    
    Pros: Keeps styles in one place for single page, no external file needed
    Cons: Not reusable across multiple pages, increases HTML file size
    
    
    3. EXTERNAL CSS
    ---------------
    Definition: CSS written in a separate .css file and linked to HTML document.
    Syntax:
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    
    Pros: Reusable across multiple pages, separates concerns, cacheable by browser
    Cons: Requires additional HTTP request (minimal impact)
    
    Best Practice: Use external CSS for most projects
    
    
    ========================================
    CSS SYNTAX STRUCTURE
    ========================================
    
    Basic Syntax:
    selector {
        property: value;
        property: value;
    }
    
    Example:
    h1 {
        color: navy;
        font-size: 24px;
        text-align: center;
    }
    
    Multiple Selectors:
    h1, h2, h3 {
        font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    
    Comments in CSS:
    /* This is a single-line comment */
    
    /*
       This is a
       multi-line comment
    */
    
    
    ========================================
    IMPORTANT CSS CONCEPTS
    ========================================
    
    1. RESPONSIVE DESIGN
    --------------------
    Definition: Approach to web design that makes pages render well on various devices 
    and screen sizes.
    
    Key Techniques:
    - Media Queries: Apply styles based on device characteristics
    - Flexible Layouts: Use relative units (%, em, rem) instead of fixed pixels
    - Flexible Images: Make images scale with their containers
    - Mobile-First Approach: Design for mobile first, then enhance for larger screens
    
    
    2. FLEXBOX
    ----------
    Definition: A one-dimensional layout method for arranging items in rows or columns.
    
    Key Properties:
    - display: flex; (on container)
    - flex-direction: row | column
    - justify-content: Aligns items along main axis
    - align-items: Aligns items along cross axis
    - flex-wrap: Controls wrapping of items
    
    
    3. CSS GRID
    -----------
    Definition: A two-dimensional layout system for creating complex grid-based layouts.
    
    Key Properties:
    - display: grid; (on container)
    - grid-template-columns: Defines column structure
    - grid-template-rows: Defines row structure
    - gap: Space between grid items
    - grid-area: Assigns items to specific grid areas
    
    
    4. TRANSITIONS & ANIMATIONS
    ---------------------------
    Transitions: Smooth changes between property values over time
    Syntax: transition: property duration timing-function delay;
    Example: transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
    
    Animations: More complex, keyframe-based animations
    Syntax:
    @keyframes animationName {
        0% { property: value; }
        100% { property: value; }
    }
    animation: animationName duration timing-function iteration-count;
    
    
    5. PSEUDO-CLASSES & PSEUDO-ELEMENTS
    -----------------------------------
    Pseudo-classes: Define special states of elements
    Examples:
    - :hover (mouse over)
    - :active (being clicked)
    - :focus (has keyboard focus)
    - :first-child, :last-child
    - :nth-child(n)
    
    Pseudo-elements: Style specific parts of elements
    Examples:
    - ::before (insert content before element)
    - ::after (insert content after element)
    - ::first-letter (first letter of text)
    - ::first-line (first line of text)
    
    
    ========================================
    CSS BEST PRACTICES
    ========================================
    
    1. Use external stylesheets for better organization and reusability
    2. Follow a naming convention (e.g., BEM - Block Element Modifier)
    3. Keep specificity low to avoid conflicts
    4. Use shorthand properties when possible (e.g., margin: 10px 20px;)
    5. Organize CSS logically (e.g., layout, typography, components)
    6. Comment your code for complex sections
    7. Use CSS variables (custom properties) for repeated values
    8. Minimize use of !important
    9. Test across different browsers and devices
    10. Optimize for performance (minimize file size, combine files)
    
    
    ========================================
    CSS VARIABLES (CUSTOM PROPERTIES)
    ========================================
    
    Definition: CSS variables allow you to store values for reuse throughout your stylesheet.
    
    Syntax:
    :root {
        --primary-color: #3498db;
        --font-size-base: 16px;
    }
    
    Usage:
    h1 {
        color: var(--primary-color);
        font-size: var(--font-size-base);
    }
    
    Benefits:
    - Easy to maintain and update
    - Can be changed dynamically with JavaScript
    - Improves code readability
    - Reduces repetition
