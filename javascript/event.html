        JAVASCRIPT EVENTS
        - Events are "signals" that something has happened in the browser.
        - Examples: A button was clicked, a page finished loading, an input field changed.

        EVENT LISTENERS
        - addEventListener(event, function): The modern way to handle events.
        - It takes the event name (e.g., 'click') and a callback function.

        THE EVENT OBJECT (e)
        - When an event occurs, the browser creates an "event object".
        - This object contains details about the event (e.g., which element was clicked, mouse coordinates).
        - Commonly used properties:
            - e.target: The element that triggered the event.
            - e.type: The type of event (e.g., 'click').

        COMMON EVENT TYPES
        1. Mouse Events: 'click', 'dblclick', 'mouseover', 'mouseout', 'mousedown', 'mouseup'.
        2. Keyboard Events: 'keydown', 'keyup', 'keypress'.
        3. Form Events: 'submit', 'change', 'input', 'focus', 'blur'.
        4. Window Events: 'load', 'resize', 'scroll', 'unload'.

        EVENT PROPAGATION
        - Bubbling: The event starts from the target element and bubbles up to its parents (default).
        - Capturing: The event starts from the window and goes down to the target element.

        EVENT METHODS
        1. e.preventDefault(): Cancels the event's default action (e.g., preventing a form from submitting).
        2. e.stopPropagation(): Prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree.
