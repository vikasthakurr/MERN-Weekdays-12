    1. WHAT IS HTML?
       - HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language.
       - It is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.
       - HTML describes the structure of a Web page using markup.
       - HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages (e.g., headings, paragraphs, links).

    2. HTML STRUCTURE:
       - An HTML document consists of a tree of elements.
       - Elements are defined by tags involved in angle brackets, like <html>.
       - Most elements have an opening tag (e.g., <p>) and a closing tag (e.g., </p>).
       - Some elements are self-closing or void elements (e.g., <br />, <img />).

    3. THE BOILERPLATE EXPLAINED BELOW:
       - The code structure you see (DOCTYPE, html, head, body) is called the "boilerplate".
       - It is the standard skeleton required for every valid HTML document.
-->

<!-- 
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    - This is the Document Type Declaration.
    - It tells the browser that this document is an HTML5 document.
    - It helps the browser render the webpage correctly in "standards mode".
    - It is NOT case sensitive, but customarily written in uppercase.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- 
    <html lang="en">
    - The <html> element is the root element of the page. All other elements are inside it.
    - The 'lang' attribute specifies the language of the document (inside the string "en" for English).
    - This is important for accessibility (screen readers) and search engines.
-->
<html lang="en">
  <!-- 
      <head>
      - The <head> element contains meta-information about the HTML page.
      - Content inside <head> is NOT displayed on the visible page itself.
      - It includes the title, character set, responsive settings, scripts, and stylesheets.
  -->
  <head>
    <!-- 
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        - This meta tag specifies the character encoding for the HTML document.
        - UTF-8 is the standard encoding that supports almost all characters and symbols in the world.
        - Without this, some special characters (like emojis or foreign letters) might display incorrectly.
    -->
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />

    <!-- 
        <meta name="viewport" ... />
        - This tag is crucial for Responsive Web Design (making sites look good on phones).
        - width=device-width: Sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device.
        - initial-scale=1.0: Sets the initial zoom level when the page is first loaded.
    -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />

    <!-- 
        <title>
        - Sets the title of the web page.
        - This is shown in the browser's title bar or the page's tab.
        - It is also the title used when the page is bookmarked or displayed in search engine results.
    -->
    <title>vikas</title>
  </head>

  <!-- 
      <body>
      - The <body> element defines the document's body.
      - It is a container for ALL the visible contents of the web page.
      - Examples: headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
  -->
  <body></body>
</html>
