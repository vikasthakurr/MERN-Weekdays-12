    ========================================
    CSS UNITS OF MEASUREMENT
    ========================================

    WHAT ARE CSS UNITS?
    -------------------
    CSS units are used to express lengths (width, height, margin, padding, font-size, etc.).
    There are two main categories of units in CSS:
    1. Absolute Units
    2. Relative Units


    1. ABSOLUTE UNITS
    -----------------
    Absolute units are fixed and will appear as exactly that size.
    They are not recommended for use on screen layouts because screen sizes vary so much.
    However, they can be useful if the output is known, such as for print layout.

    Common Absolute Units:
    - px (Pixels): Use for screen media (1px = 1/96th of 1in). Most common absolute unit.
    - cm (Centimeters)
    - mm (Millimeters)
    - in (Inches): 1in = 96px = 2.54cm
    - pt (Points): 1pt = 1/72 of 1in
    - pc (Picas): 1pc = 12pt

    Note: Pixels (px) are relative to the viewing device. For low-dpi devices, 1px is one device pixel (dot) of the display. For high-resolution screens, 1px implies multiple device pixels.


    2. RELATIVE UNITS
    -----------------
    Relative units specify a length relative to another length property.
    Relative units scale better between different rendering mediums (e.g., desktop vs mobile).

    A. FONT-RELATIVE UNITS
    ----------------------
    - em: Relative to the font-size of the element (2em means 2 times the size of the current font).
      * Exception: When used on 'font-size' property itself, it is relative to the parent's font-size.
    - rem: Relative to the font-size of the root element (html).
      * "r" stands for "root".
      * Better for maintenance than 'em' because it doesn't compound (cascade) through nesting.
    - ch: Relative to the width of the "0" (zero) character.
    - ex: Relative to the x-height of the current font (rarely used).

    B. VIEWPORT-RELATIVE UNITS
    --------------------------
    - vw: Relative to 1% of the width of the viewport.
    - vh: Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport.
    - vmin: Relative to 1% of viewport's smaller dimension (height or width).
    - vmax: Relative to 1% of viewport's larger dimension (height or width).

    C. PERCENTAGE
    -------------
    - %: Relative to the parent element.


    DEEP DIVE: EM vs REM vs PX
    --------------------------

    1. Pixels (px):
       - Precise control.
       - Does not scale if user changes browser default font size.
       - Good for borders or shadows where precise alignment matters.

    2. Ems (em):
       - Scalable.
       - Compounding issue: Nested elements with em font sizes multiply (e.g., 2em inside 2em = 4em).
       - Good for padding/margin relative to the text size of that specific component.

    3. Rems (rem):
       - Scalable and consistent.
       - Always relative to <html> font-size (usually 16px by default).
       - Easy to reset global sizing (just change html font-size).
       - Best practice for general layout, spacing, and typography sizing.


    EXAMPLE CALCULATIONS
    --------------------
    Assuming default browser font-size is 16px:

    - 1rem = 16px
    - 2rem = 32px
    - 1.5rem = 24px (1.5 * 16)
    - 0.875rem = 14px (0.875 * 16)

    Tip: Setting html { font-size: 62.5%; } makes 1rem = 10px (16px * 0.625), making calculations easier.
